# StoryTeller

StoryTeller was a partwork series from the early eighties published in the UK and around the world.  This project is to create map/index files in JSON format that describes the PDF/MP3 collections and to provide code/applications in order to consume these files and display them.

It is in the very early stages and progress will not be super-fast - it is also a very niche project for a specific group of nostalgic folks who loved these stories as children and want to continue enjoying them and sharing them with their families! :)
